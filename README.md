# identityverify

A trial mobile app showcasing the use of modern ai in application authentication. This app uses SCIM, which stands for System for Cross-domain Identity Management. SCIM is designed to make it easier to manage user identities in a heterogeneous environment, especially when multiple cloud-based services and applications are involved.
